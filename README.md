##Simon's Revenge

This project is a more explosive version of the hit 80s game Simonâ„¢.

Literally.

Simon has gotten fed up of people making clones of his  game and sent a special gift to just for you!

The aim of the game is simple. Use your mouse to try to keep the bomb from exploding by matching the sequence with you mouse and try to delay the inevitable.

If you are **Correct**, you delay the bomb by 10 seconds and get 10 points.

If you are **Wrong**, lose some points and speed up the timer.

Impress you friends with your memory skills!
